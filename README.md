# Recoil Corrections

Code used to study the corrections and uncertainties of DeepMET. In principle it should work on any type of MET. 

The code needs [https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html](RDataFrame), which becomes an official part
of ROOT since ROOT 6.14. Tested and confirmed at least CMSSW_10_6_0 works (with ROOT 6.14.09)
